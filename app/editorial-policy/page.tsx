    "How we use AI",
    "We use AI to help draft and edit content. It does not supply personal experience, professional credentials or evidence for factual claims. Our publishing standard is to check facts against relevant sources and have the responsible person approve a personal byline."

  [
    "Facts and recommendations",

    "If you spot a factual error or outdated detail, contact us through the site’s contact information and include the page and the detail that needs checking. Publication and modification dates should reflect actual publication and substantive edits."
